drawing manger terminal

I did the below post on DEV Community the better describes this project:
## Why??

Being a civil engineer working on construction management I've gone through dozens of different softwares to organize and manage communication regarding construction drawings. 

Since trying to shift my career into software engineering, I decided to start with trying to build my own little terminal project to learn python. 

## What is does?
This script main idea is track construction drawings with their revision, add new revisions, new Request For Information (RFIs) and related them to each consultant (subject). 

The menus would guide you to what you need (like information and status of items and if you wanna add or change something).

## Thanks!
It looks basic but I took it as a big thing having little time to manage between working, having 2 toddlers and learn. Thanks all for the support!
